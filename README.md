Microservices Architecture:

User Authentication Service:
Responsible for handling user registration, login, and authentication.
Exposes endpoints for user registration and authentication.
Utilizes token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for secure communication with other services.
Ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
Product Management Service:
Manages product information, including CRUD operations.
Implements optimistic locking for concurrent access control.
Exposes RESTful APIs for product CRUD operations.
Communicates with the User Authentication Service to ensure that only authorized users can modify product data.
Handles product-related events (e.g., product creation, update) asynchronously using message queues for better scalability.
Order Processing Service:
Handles order creation, updates, and order history.
Exposes endpoints for order management.
Communicates with the User Authentication Service to ensure that users can only access their own orders.
Interacts with the Product Management Service to fetch product details for orders.
Utilizes message queues for asynchronous communication to enhance performance.
Communication Between Microservices:

Microservices communicate through RESTful APIs.
User Authentication Service issues and verifies authentication tokens.
Product Management Service and Order Processing Service interact to fulfill order-related operations.
Event-driven communication using message queues for asynchronous processing of certain tasks, enhancing system responsiveness.
Assumptions (Documented in README):

Clarify any assumptions made during the design, such as specific technologies chosen, token expiration policies, message queue choices, etc.
This architecture promotes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain, making it easier to scale, deploy, and update independently. Now, let's move on to concurrency control for the Product Management Service.
